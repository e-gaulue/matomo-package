 Please choose whether you want to enable automatic database upgrade for your Piwik installation.
 .
 From time to time, Piwik database schema must be upgraded so Piwik can
 continue to work correctly. You have the ability to automate the process
 so the database is upgraded automatically. Though, you should ensure you
 have proper backup in place and keep in mind that major Piwik version
 updates may come with many DB updates that can take a long time.
 .
 If enable, the database update will be executed and it remains as
 such for all future package upgrades when required.
 .
 If disable, you will need to take care of database updates yourself
 after a package upgrade. In such a case, Piwik will show the list of
 database queries that need to be executed in the UI.
 .
 You may change the previously selected behaviour using the following debian
 command: dpk-reconfigure matomo
