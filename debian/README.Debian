Install
=======

1 - Create a MariaDB / MySQL database named "matomo"
	CREATE DATABASE `matomo` /*!40100 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 */;

2 - Create a user/password with access to the database previously created
	CREATE USER matomo@localhost IDENTIFIED BY '4/V3ryStron6!*passW0rd';
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON matomo.* to matomo@localhost;
	-- the FILE privileges is optional, but matomo can leverage that feature
	-- to improve performance
	GRANT FILE ON *.* TO matomo@localhost;

3a- If you don't have any virtualhost, uncomment the Alias line in /etc/apache2/conf.d/matomo.conf

3b- If you operate with virtualhosts, do as follow
	a) if you use a dedicated virtual host for your matomo
	<VirtualHost *:80>
		[...]
		DocumentRoot /usr/share/matomo
		[...]
	</VirtualHost>

	b) if you want the matomo Alias in all your virtualhosts, uncomment the Alias line in /etc/apache2/conf.d/matomo.conf

	c) if you prefer to restrict matomo Alias to a specific virtualhost
	<VirtualHost *:80>
		[...]
		DocumentRoot /var/www/foo

		Alias /matomo /usr/share/matomo
		[...]
	</VirtualHost>

3c- Ensure conf-available/matomo.conf is enable

4 - Point your browser to your matomo URL

5 - Follow the steps and provide the MariaDB / MySQL credential details when requested.

6 - Add the given javascript code to your pages, ideally at the bottom of the html just before </body>

Cron job
========

The Debian matomo package also provides a crontab file /etc/cron.d/matomo
It's released commented out, but we highly recommend to uncomment it to make sure Piwik loads very fast.
